    "#### An exception in Python is an abnormal event or runtime error that occurs when a program is executed. Exceptions are usually raised when the program encounters unexpected or erroneous conditions such as an index out-of-bounds error, a divide-by-zero error, or an input/output error.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors occur when the Python interpreter encounters incorrect syntax in the program source code, and it raises a SyntaxError exception. On the other hand, exceptions are raised at runtime when the program encounters unexpected conditions such as a file not found error or an attempt to divide by zero. Syntax errors are easier to detect and fix because they are caught by the Python interpreter at the time the code is compiled. Exceptions, on the other hand, are raised during the execution of the program, and may not be detected immediately."
